Hey there,

Welcome to the P2PU mentorship program. Get started by creating a project to start collaborating with mentors and learners. We'll notify you when someone is interested in joining your project. 

How can I speed up the process?
Mentors are in high demand. Get supporters by sharing this link: {{mentorship.share_url}}. The more supporters you gain the more likely you are to be chosen by a mentor. In the meantime continue learning. 

Thanks,
The P2PU Mentorship Team
